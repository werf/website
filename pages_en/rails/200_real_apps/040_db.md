  In this chapter, we will deploy a database, configure our application to use it, and set up automatic DB migrations and initializations.
---

## Making our application stateful

At this point, our application does not use a database and does not store any data (i.e., it is stateless). To make it stateful, we need to enable Active Record and configure the application to work with MySQL (we will use the database to store the application state).

To get the Active Record and MySQL configuration, let's generate a skeleton Rails application using the following command (note that the `--database mysql` flag is added to the arguments while `--skip-active-record` is omitted):
```shell
rails new --database mysql --skip-keeps --skip-action-mailer --skip-action-mailbox --skip-action-text --skip-active-job --skip-active-storage --skip-action-cable --skip-sprockets --skip-spring --skip-listen --skip-turbolinks --skip-jbuilder --skip-test --skip-system-test --skip-bootsnap .
```

The following changes have been made to our application:
1. Adding `mysql2` to [Gemfile]({{ page.base_url | append: page.examples | append: "/Gemfile" }}).
1. Enabling Active Record in [config/application.rb]({{ page.base_url | append: page.examples | append: "/config/application.rb" }}).
1. Generating a [config/database.yml]({{ page.base_url | append: page.examples | append: "/config/database.yml" }})  configuration file..

## Adding `/remember` and `/say` endpoints to the application

Let's add two new endpoints to our application. The `/remember` endpoint will save the data to the database while the `/say` endpoint will retrieve the data from it.

Below are listings for a new controller and model:
{% include snippetcut_example path="app/controllers/talker_controller.rb" syntax="rb" examples=page.examples %}
{% include snippetcut_example path="app/models/talker.rb" syntax="rb" examples=page.examples %}

Let's add new paths to the route list:
{% include snippetcut_example path="config/routes.rb" syntax="rb" examples=page.examples %}

Now it's time to define two basic migrations:
{% include snippetcut_example path="db/migrate/20210817162438_create_talkers.rb" syntax="rb" examples=page.examples %}
{% include snippetcut_example path="db/migrate/20210817164348_add_name_to_talkers.rb" syntax="rb" examples=page.examples %}

... and `schema.rb` generated based on those migrations:
{% include snippetcut_example path="db/schema.rb" syntax="rb" examples=page.examples %}

New endpoints, `/remember` and `/say`, are ready.

## Deploying a MySQL database and connecting to it

In real life, a database can be a part of the Kubernetes infrastructure or run outside of it. Outside of Kubernetes, you can deploy and maintain a database yourself or use a managed solution like Amazon RDS. For illustrative purposes, let's deploy a MySQL database to the Kubernetes cluster using the following basic StatefulSet:
{% include snippetcut_example path=".helm/templates/database.yaml" syntax="yaml" examples=page.examples %}
>_Note that you can also use a database deployed differently. In this case, you will not need the above StatefulSet, while all further steps remain unchanged._

Now let's configure our application to use the new database:
{% include snippetcut_example path="config/database.yml" syntax="yaml" examples=page.examples %}

Great, the database and the application are ready to be deployed.

## Initializing and migrating the database

There are several ways to initialize and migrate a database when deploying applications to Kubernetes. We will use one straightforward yet efficient method. It involves database migration (and initialization, if needed) by a dedicated Job simultaneously with deploying the application and the database.

We require the following conditions to be met to deploy resources in the desired order:
1. Before starting, the job to initialize/migrate the database must make sure the database is available and ready.
1. Before starting, applications must wait until the database is available _and_ ready _and_ all migrations are complete.

This way, all K8s resources are created at the same time but being run in the following order:
1. The database starts.
1. The initialization/migration Job runs.
1. The applications start.

Let's now add a Job to perform database migrations/initializations:
{% include snippetcut_example path=".helm/templates/job-db-setup-and-migrate.yaml" syntax="yaml" examples=page.examples %}

{% offtopic title="Why wait for ten consecutive successful DB availability checks?" %}
Running `mysqladmin ping`, say, once may result in an incorrect conclusion that the database is ready. This is because the check has been completed before MySQL's StatefulSet restart during deployment. In such cases, the database may be unavailable during initialization/migrations.

In addition, in database images, the main database process may restart several times during the first run (while the container does not restart). In this case, the single database check may show that the database is ready; next, the initialization/migration job starts only to find that the main database process is restarting. To avoid this, we run `mysqladmin ping` several times in a row.

You can change the number of successful checks in a row; 10 is used as an example.
{% endofftopic %}

Now let's add an *init container* to the application's Deployment. It will wait until the database is ready/initialized and the migrations are completed:
{% include snippetcut_example path=".helm/templates/deployment.yaml" syntax="yaml" examples=page.examples %}

## Testing the application/database

Let's deploy the application:
```shell
werf converge --repo <DOCKER HUB USERNAME>/werf-guide-app
```

You should see the following output:
```shell

Release "werf-guide-app" has been upgraded. Happy Helming!
NAME: werf-guide-app
LAST DEPLOYED: Wed Aug 18 15:02:13 2021
NAMESPACE: werf-guide-app
STATUS: deployed
REVISION: 5
TEST SUITE: None
```

Now let's try to access the `/say` endpoint that retrieves the data from the database:
```shell
curl http://werf-guide-app/say
```

Since the database is still empty, it should return the following message:
```shell
I have nothing to say.
```

Let's save some data to the database using `/remember`:
```shell
curl "http://werf-guide-app/remember?answer=Love+you&name=sweetie"
```

The database must respond with the following:
```shell
Got it.
```

Let's try to retrieve the data from the database using the `/say` endpoint once again:
```shell
curl http://werf-guide-app/say
```

If successful, you will see the following output:
```shell
Love you, sweetie!
```

You can also make sure that the data is in the database by directly querying the table contents:
```shell
kubectl exec -it statefulset/mysql -- mysql -ppassword -e "SELECT * from talkers" werf-guide-app
```

You should see the following output:
```shell
+----+----------+---------+
| id | answer   | name    |
+----+----------+---------+
|  0 | Love you | sweetie |
+----+----------+---------+
```

Done!

In this chapter, we turned our application into a stateful one by connecting it to the corresponding database. We deployed the database to the Kubernetes cluster, initialized it, and performed necessary DB migrations. Note that the above approach should work well with any relational database.

_As usual, you can see all the changes made in this chapter by running the commands provided at the [beginning](#preparing-the-repository)._

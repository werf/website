  This chapter provides essential information for using werf comfortably:

  - **Principles of working with source code and giterminism**. These ensure reliability and reproducibility and unify all processes.
  - werf's **image tagging strategy**. This strategy _frees you of worries_ about tagging rules, building and deploying images.
  - What is a **release** and how to **debug** it.
  - How to free up **space in the image repository** that will run out sooner or later.

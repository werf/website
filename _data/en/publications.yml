      <p>werf is a CLI <a target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" href="https://github.com/werf/werf">Open Source</a> tool for building applications and deploying them to Kubernetes clusters. Version 1.2 features many new changes and improvements. We have been thoroughly testing and refining them as part of the Early-Access version over the last eleven months (since January 2021). Finally, we are pleased to announce that it has been promoted to Stable!</p>

      <p>This article is the next installment in the “werf vs. …” series. In the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" href="https://blog.flant.com/werf-vs-helm-comparison/">previous article</a>, we discussed the ways that werf differs from Helm. This article compares werf with an even more basic tool: Docker.</p>

      <p>This article attempts to provide a detailed answer to a question we stumble upon every now and then: What is the difference between werf and Helm? At first glance, both of these tools seem to be designed with the same purpose: automating application deployment in Kubernetes. However, the reality is a little more complicated than that.</p>

      <p>The werf tool is designed to easily integrate with any CI/CD system. The general approach to this process is provided in the epilogue, while the main part of this article discusses the practical example of organizing a CI process in Jenkins and Bitbucket.</p>
      <p>After reading this article, you will learn how to:</p>
      <ul><li>create a Jenkins Shared Library to store all CI scripts in one place and edit them via a single commit;</li>
      <li>integrate Jenkins with Bitbucket to trigger CI processes by committing to specific branches or by creating a tag.</li></ul>

      <p>GitOps is a modern way to make better IaC for delivering apps in Kubernetes. It is all about giterminism, idempotence, automation, observability… and many other exciting features! However, are you sure all this happens in the real world using existing approach and tools? Here’s our comprehensive analysis of GitOps and its features, comparison with CIOps as well as insights on how this all should be done to actually get what each DevOps engineer dreams of.</p>

      <p>werf is a CLI tool that glues well-established software (Git, Docker, Kubernetes, Helm, a variety of container registries & CI systems) to facilitate applications’ delivery. In this webinar, developers, release engineers & SREs will learn how they can benefit from werf in their infrastructure, release management & CI/CD pipelines. Using Git as a single source of truth, we will build images of a simple Node.js application, push them into registry, deploy to Kubernetes and integrate with GitLab CI. You will also see how actual Kubernetes deployments are kept always in sync with your defined state via GitOps push-based approach.</p>

      <p>While implementing CI/CD processes for a variety of developer teams, we've realised that container registries (Docker Registry, GitLab Container Registry, etc.) usually don't provide flexible & powerful policies to clean up the images that are not in use. As modern cloud-native applications development requires to deliver a huge amount of builds (images) to Kubernetes, you might end up with either an overfilled registry or lacking an important image in your infrastructure (or registry) when it's needed. Here are our thoughts on this issue and how we have resolved it away from the registries themselves, in our Open Source tool (werf).</p>

      <p>Container registries tend to support the Docker Registry HTTP API, allowing their users to rely on the same tools to operate them. However, some implementations have their peculiarities and limitations. Thus, you have to take into account their specifics when using them as part of your CI/CD toolchain. That is exactly what happened when we decided to improve the way our werf GitOps utility manages the lifecycle of images.</p>

      <p>werf is our Open Source GitOps tool to build your applications and deploy them to Kubernetes. The<a href="https://blog.flant.com/werf-1-1-release-notes-and-future-plans/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow"> v1.1</a> release introduced a new feature in the image builder: the <em>content-based tagging</em>. Until now, the typical tagging strategy in werf involved tagging Docker images by a Git tag, Git branch, or Git commit. However, all these strategies have drawbacks that are fully resolved by implementing the new tagging strategy. In this article, we discuss its advantages.</p>

      <p>In <a href="https://flant.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Flant</a>, we are often confronted with the challenge of adapting applications for running them in Kubernetes. When dealing with this challenge, we usually encounter many repetitive problems.

      <p>Let’s start with a theory. What are three-way-merge patches? How they’ve been invented, and why they are so essential for CI/CD processes with a Kubernetes-based infrastructure? And later, we will discuss the 3-way-merge process in werf, what modes are used by default, and how can you manage all this stuff.</p>

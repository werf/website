      <p>For four years, we have been developing and improving werf 1.2. Now, we are proud to unveil werf 2.0 stable! It accumulates all changes delivered to werf throughout the last 300+ releases and comes with Nelm — our new deployment engine, replacing Helm. Nelm is backward compatible with Helm, so there’s no need to make any special changes to the charts — you can use them just like before.</p>

      <p>Werf is a Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) tool that simplifies the process of building, testing, releasing, and deploying applications to Kubernetes. It’s an Open Source project under the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF), designated as a sandbox project as of December 13, 2022​.<br><br>Werf was designed to address the complexities and inconsistencies encountered in CI/CD processes, especially when deploying applications to Kubernetes. It originated in a professional services company that provided DevOps as a Service, Flant. The motivation behind its creation was to standardize and automate the implementation of CI/CD pipelines across various projects​.</p>

      <p>Canary releases are quite a popular and well-covered phenomenon (see, for example, links to other articles on our blog below). But I would still like to briefly overview what they are used for.
      <br><br>
      Canary deployment is a good way to test new features on a subset of users. A specific subset of users is selected based on a particular attribute. At the same time, testing activities cannot affect the user experience on the main application version. The load between the two app versions should be allocated in a predictable fashion.</p>

      <p>werf is a CLI tool that glues well-established software (Git, Docker, Kubernetes, Helm, a variety of container registries & CI systems) to facilitate applications’ delivery. In this webinar, developers, release engineers & SREs will learn how they can benefit from werf in their infrastructure, release management & CI/CD pipelines. Using Git as a single source of truth, we will build images of a simple Node.js application, push them into registry, deploy to Kubernetes and integrate with GitLab CI. You will also see how actual Kubernetes deployments are kept always in sync with your defined state via GitOps push-based approach.</p>

      <p>While implementing CI/CD processes for a variety of developer teams, we've realised that container registries (Docker Registry, GitLab container registry, etc.) usually don't provide flexible & powerful policies to clean up the images that are not in use. As modern cloud-native applications development requires to deliver a huge amount of builds (images) to Kubernetes, you might end up with either an overfilled registry or lacking an important image in your infrastructure (or registry) when it's needed. Here are our thoughts on this issue and how we have resolved it away from the registries themselves, in our Open Source tool (werf).</p>

      <p>Container registries tend to support the Docker Registry HTTP API, allowing their users to rely on the same tools to operate them. However, some implementations have their peculiarities and limitations. Thus, you have to take into account their specifics when using them as part of your CI/CD toolchain. That is exactly what happened when we decided to improve the way our werf GitOps utility manages the lifecycle of images.</p>

      <p>werf is our Open Source GitOps tool to build your applications and deploy them to Kubernetes. The v1.1 release introduced a new feature in the image builder: the <em>content-based tagging</em>. Until now, the typical tagging strategy in werf involved tagging Docker images by a Git tag, Git branch, or Git commit. However, all these strategies have drawbacks that are fully resolved by implementing the new tagging strategy. In this article, we discuss its advantages.</p>

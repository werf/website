### Configuring CI/CD of the project

This is how the repository that uses werf for build and deploy might look:

{% tree_file_viewer '/examples/configurator/ci-cd/simple/other/host-runner/linux/docker' default_file='pseudo-ci-cd-config.yaml' %}

Extras:
  * Add authorization options for `werf cleanup` in the container registry by following [instructions]({{ "/docs/v2/usage/cleanup/cr_cleanup.html#features-of-working-with-different-container-registries" | relative_url }}).

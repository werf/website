## Requirements

- CI system;

- Linux host to run CI jobs, with:

  * Shell Runner of your CI system of choice;

  * Bash;

  * Git version 2.18.0 or above;

  * GPG.

## Installing Buildah

To install Buildah, do the following on the host for running CI jobs:

- Install the Buildah package following the [official instructions](https://github.com/containers/buildah/blob/main/install.md) but refrain from configuring it. If there are no pre-made Buildah packages for your distribution, refer to the following guidelines:

  {% offtopic title="Installing Buildah  manually" %}

  - Install packages for `newuidmap` and `newgidmap`.

  - Make sure that `newuidmap` and `newgidmap` have the proper permissions set:

    ```yaml
    sudo setcap cap_setuid+ep /usr/bin/newuidmap
    sudo setcap cap_setgid+ep /usr/bin/newgidmap
    sudo chmod u-s,g-s /usr/bin/newuidmap /usr/bin/newgidmap
    ```

  - Install the package that provides the `/etc/subuid` and `/etc/subgid` files.

  - Make sure that the `/etc/subuid` and `/etc/subgid` files have a line similar to `runner:1000000:65536`, where

    - `runner` — name of the user to run the CI jobs;

    - `1000000` — first subUID/subGID in the allocated range;

    - `65536` — subUIDs/subGIDs range size (min `65536`).

    Avoid conflicts with other ranges, if any. Changing files may require a reboot. See `man subuid` and `man subgid` for details.

  {% endofftopic %}

- (For Linux 5.12 and below) Install the package that provides the `fuse-overlayfs` utility.

- Make sure the `/home/<user to run CI jobs>/.local/share/containers` path is created and the user to run CI jobs has read and write access.

- The `sysctl -ne kernel.unprivileged_userns_clone` command should NOT return `0`, otherwise run `echo 'kernel.unprivileged_userns_clone = 1' | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf && sudo sysctl -p`.

- The `sysctl -n user.max_user_namespaces` command should return `15000` or more, otherwise run `echo 'user.max_user_namespaces = 15000' | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf && sudo sysctl -p`.

## Installing werf

On the host for running CI jobs, run the following command to install werf:

```shell
curl -sSL https://werf.io/install.sh | bash -s -- --ci
```

## Configuring the container registry

[Enable garbage collection]({{ "/documentation/v" | append: include.version | append: "/usage/cleanup/cr_cleanup.html#container-registrys-garbage-collector" | relative_url }}) for your container registry.

## Configuring CI/CD of the project

This is what configuration for running werf on your CI system might look like:

```yaml
# .pseudo-ci-config.yml:
environment_variables:
  WERF_BUILDAH_MODE: auto
  WERF_REPO: registry.example.org/myrepo
  WERF_ENV: "${CI_ENVIRONMENT}"
  WERF_ENABLE_PROCESS_EXTERMINATOR: "1"

before_every_job:
- source "$(~/bin/trdl use werf {{ include.version }} {{ include.channel }})"
- werf cr login -u "${REGISTRY_USER:?}" -p "${REGISTRY_PASSWORD:?}" "${WERF_REPO:?}"

jobs:
  prod:
    commands:
    - werf converge
    environment: prod
    on: master
    how: manually

  images:cleanup:
    commands:
    - werf cleanup
    on: master
    how: daily
```

Extras steps:
  * Add authorization options for `werf cleanup` in the container registry by following [instructions]({{ "/documentation/v{{ include.version }}/usage/cleanup/cr_cleanup.html#features-of-working-with-different-container-registries" | relative_url }}).

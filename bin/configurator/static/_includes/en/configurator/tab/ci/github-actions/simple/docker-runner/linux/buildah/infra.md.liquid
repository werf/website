> Preparing your infrastructure for self-hosting GitHub Runner

### Requirements

- GitHub Actions;

- Host to run GitHub Runner with:

  - [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/).

### Prepare the environment

(For Ubuntu 23.10 and later) on the GitHub Runner host run:

```shell
{ echo "kernel.apparmor_restrict_unprivileged_userns = 0" && echo "kernel.apparmor_restrict_unprivileged_unconfined = 0";} | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.d/20-apparmor-donotrestrict.conf && sudo sysctl -p /etc/sysctl.d/20-apparmor-donotrestrict.conf
```

### Installing GitHub Runner

Install GitHub Runner on its dedicated host by following the [official instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/managing-self-hosted-runners/adding-self-hosted-runners).

{% include configurator/partials/ci/configuring_the_container_registry.md.liquid %}

### Preparing the system for cross-platform building (optional)

{% include configurator/partials/ci/cross_platform_note.md.liquid %}


Register emulators on your system using qemu-user-static:

```shell
docker run --restart=always --name=qemu-user-static -d --privileged --entrypoint=/bin/sh multiarch/qemu-user-static -c "/register --reset -p yes && tail -f /dev/null"
```

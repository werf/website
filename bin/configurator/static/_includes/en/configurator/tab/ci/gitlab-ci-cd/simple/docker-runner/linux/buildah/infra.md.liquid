## Requirements

- GitLab;

- Host to run GitLab Runner with:

  - [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/).

## Installing GitLab Runner

Install GitLab Runner on its dedicated host by following the [official instructions](https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/install/linux-repository.html).

## Registering GitLab Runner

Follow [official instructions](https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/register/index.html) to register GitLab Runner in GitLab; specify Docker as the executor and any image as the image (e.g. `alpine`).

## Configuring GitLab Runner

On the GitLab Runner host, open its `config.toml` configuration file and add the following options to the GitLab Runner you registered earlier:

```toml
[[runners]]
  name = "<name of the Runner you registered>"
  [runners.docker]
    security_opt = ["seccomp:unconfined", "apparmor:unconfined"]
    volumes = ["/home/build/.werf"]
```

If the GitLab Runner host runs Linux kernel version 5.12 or lower, install `fuse` on the host and add an extra option to the `config.toml` file:

```toml
[[runners]]
  name = "<name of the Runner you registered>"
  [runners.docker]
    devices = ["/dev/fuse"]
```

If needed, perform [additional configuration](https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/configuration/advanced-configuration.html) of the GitLab Runner.

## Configuring the container registry

[Enable garbage collection](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/packages/container_registry.html#container-registry-garbage-collection) for your container registry.

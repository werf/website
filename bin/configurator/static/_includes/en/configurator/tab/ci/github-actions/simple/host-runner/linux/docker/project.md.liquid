### Requirements

* GitHub Actions;

* GitHub-hosted Runner or self-hosted runner.

### Setting up a GitHub project

* [Create and save the access token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens) to clean up the no longer needed images from the container registry with the following parameters:

  * Token name: `werf-images-cleanup`;

  * Scopes: `read:packages` and `delete:packages`.

* Add the following variable to the project [secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-for-github-actions/security-guides/using-secrets-in-github-actions):

  * Access token to clean up the no longer needed images:

    * Name: `REGISTRY_CLEANUP_TOKEN`;

    * Secret: `<"werf-images-cleanup" access token you saved earlier>`.

* Save the kubeconfig file to access the Kubernetes cluster as a `KUBECONFIG_BASE64` [encrypted secret](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/encrypted-secrets), pre-encoding it in Base64.

### Configuring CI/CD of the project

This is how the repository that uses werf for build and deploy might look:

{% tree_file_viewer '/examples/configurator/ci-cd/simple/github-actions/host-runner/linux/docker' default_file='.github/workflows/prod.yml' %}

Extras:

  * To use GitHub-hosted Runner, specify `ubuntu-latest` in `runs-on`;

  * If you're not using GitHub Container Registry as your container registry, follow these steps:

    * Set the `WERF_REPO` environment variable to your container registry address;
    * Log in to the registry using [werf cr login]({{ "/docs/reference/cli/werf_cr_login.html" | relative_url }});
    * When performing cleanup, make sure to review [specific features]({{ "/docs/usage/cleanup/cr_cleanup.html#features-of-working-with-different-container-registries" | relative_url }}) of your registry that may affect cleanup behavior.

  * See the [authentication guide]({{ "/docs/v2/usage/deploy/authentication.html" | relative_url }}) for more information on accessing the Kubernetes cluster.

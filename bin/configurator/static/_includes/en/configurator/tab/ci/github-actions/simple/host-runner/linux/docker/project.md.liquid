### Requirements

* GitHub Actions;

* GitHub-hosted Linux Runner.

### Setting up a GitHub project

Save the kubeconfig file to access the Kubernetes cluster as a `KUBECONFIG_BASE64` [encrypted secret](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/encrypted-secrets), pre-encoding it in Base64.

### Configuring CI/CD of the project

This is how the repository that uses werf for build and deploy might look:

{% tree_file_viewer '/examples/configurator/ci-cd/simple/github-actions/host-runner/linux/buildah' default_file='.github/workflows/prod.yml' %}

Extras:
  * Add authorization options for `werf cleanup` in the container registry by following [instructions]({{ "/documentation/v1.2/usage/cleanup/cr_cleanup.html#features-of-working-with-different-container-registries" | relative_url }}).

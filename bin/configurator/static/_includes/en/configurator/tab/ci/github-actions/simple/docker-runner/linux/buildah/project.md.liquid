### Requirements

* GitHub Actions;

* GitHub-hosted Runner or self-hosted runner.

### Setting up a GitHub project

* [Create and save the access token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens) to clean up the no longer needed images from the container registry with the following parameters:

  * Token name: `werf-images-cleanup`;

  * Scopes: `read:packages` and `delete:packages`.

* Add the following variable to the project [secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-for-github-actions/security-guides/using-secrets-in-github-actions):

  * Access token to clean up the no longer needed images:

    * Name: `REGISTRY_CLEANUP_TOKEN`;

    * Secret: `<"werf-images-cleanup" access token you saved earlier>`.

* [Add a scheduled nightly task](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/writing-workflows/choosing-when-your-workflow-runs/events-that-trigger-workflows#schedule) to clean up the no longer needed images in the container registry by setting the main/master branch as the Target branch.

* Save the kubeconfig file to access the Kubernetes cluster as a `KUBECONFIG_BASE64` [encrypted secret](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/encrypted-secrets), pre-encoding it in Base64.

### Configuring CI/CD of the project

This is how the repository that uses werf for build and deploy might look:

{% tree_file_viewer '/examples/configurator/ci-cd/simple/github-actions/docker-runner/linux/buildah' default_file='.github/workflows/prod.yml' %}

Extras:

  * To use GitHub-hosted Runner, specify `ubuntu-latest` in `runs-on`;

  * Add authorization options for `werf cleanup` in the container registry by following [instructions]({{ "/docs/v2/usage/cleanup/cr_cleanup.html#features-of-working-with-different-container-registries" | relative_url }});

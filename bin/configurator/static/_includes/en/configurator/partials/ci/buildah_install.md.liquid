### Installing Buildah

Follow these steps on the GitLab Runner host to install Buildah:

* Install the Buildah package following the [official instructions](https://github.com/containers/buildah/blob/main/install.md) but avoid configuring it. If there are no ready-made Buildah packages for your distribution, refer to the following guidelines:

  - Install the packages for `newuidmap` and `newgidmap`.

  - Make sure that `newuidmap` and `newgidmap` have the proper permissions:

    ```yaml
    sudo setcap cap_setuid+ep /usr/bin/newuidmap
    sudo setcap cap_setgid+ep /usr/bin/newgidmap
    sudo chmod u-s,g-s /usr/bin/newuidmap /usr/bin/newgidmap
    ```

  - Install the package that provides the `/etc/subuid` and `/etc/subgid` files.

  - Make sure that the `/etc/subuid` and `/etc/subgid` files have a line similar to `gitlab-runner:1000000:65536`, where

    * `gitlab-runner` — name of the GitLab Runner user;

    * `1000000` — the first subUID/subGID in the range to be allocated;

    * `65536` — subUIDs/subGIDs range size (min `65536`).

    Make sure there are no conflicts with other ranges, if any. Changing files may require a reboot. See `man subuid` and `man subgid` for details.

* (Linux 5.12 and below) Install the package that provides the `fuse-overlayfs` utility.

* Make sure that the `/home/gitlab-runner/.local/share/containers` path is created and the `gitlab-runner` user has read and write access.

* The `sysctl -ne kernel.unprivileged_userns_clone` command should NOT return `0`, otherwise run `echo 'kernel.unprivileged_userns_clone = 1' | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf && sudo sysctl -p`.

* The `sysctl -n user.max_user_namespaces` command should return `15000` or more, otherwise run `echo 'user.max_user_namespaces = 15000' | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf && sudo sysctl -p`.

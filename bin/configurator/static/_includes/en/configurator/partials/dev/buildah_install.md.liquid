### Installing Buildah

Perform the following steps to install Buildah:

* Install the Buildah package following the [official instructions](https://github.com/containers/buildah/blob/main/install.md) but refrain from configuring it. If there are no pre-made Buildah packages for your distribution, refer to the following guidelines:

  - Install packages for `newuidmap` and `newgidmap`.

  - Make sure that `newuidmap` and `newgidmap` have the proper permissions:

    ```yaml
    sudo setcap cap_setuid+ep /usr/bin/newuidmap
    sudo setcap cap_setgid+ep /usr/bin/newgidmap
    sudo chmod u-s,g-s /usr/bin/newuidmap /usr/bin/newgidmap
    ```

  - Install the package that provides the `/etc/subuid` and `/etc/subgid` files.

  - Make sure that the `/etc/subuid` and `/etc/subgid` files contain a line similar to `user:1000000:65536`, where

    - `user` — name of the current user;

    - `1000000` — first subUID/subGID in the range to be allocated;

    - `65536` — subUIDs/subGIDs range size (min `65536`).

    Avoid conflicts with other ranges, if any. Changing files may require a reboot. See `man subuid` and `man subgid` for details.

* (For Linux 5.12 and below) Install the package that provides the `fuse-overlayfs` utility.

* Make sure that the `/home/<current user>/.local/share/containers` path has been created and the current user has read and write access to it.

* The `sysctl -ne kernel.unprivileged_userns_clone` command should NOT return `0`, otherwise run `echo 'kernel.unprivileged_userns_clone = 1' | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf && sudo sysctl -p`.

* The `sysctl -n user.max_user_namespaces` command should return `15000` or more, otherwise run `echo 'user.max_user_namespaces = 15000' | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf && sudo sysctl -p`.

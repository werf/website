## A new {{ page.framework_name }} application

In this chapter, we will use a new basic {{ page.framework_name }} application with the same feature set as the application from the previous section.

{% include 200_real_apps/010_basic_app/{{ page.framework_id }}/how_basic_app_was_made.md.liquid %}

As for the building and CI/CD, the most significant changes affected the image build process:
{% include snippetcut_example path="Dockerfile" syntax="dockerfile" examples=page.examples %}

… while CI/CD changes were minimal. For example, here is the Deployment of the new application:
{% include snippetcut_example path=".helm/templates/deployment.yaml" syntax="yaml" examples=page.examples %}

Our current application is stateless and does not need a database to run. We will show you how to turn it into a stateful application and deploy a dedicated database in the following chapters.

## Deploying a new application

Let's check if the new application is running fine by deploying it to the Kubernetes cluster:
```shell
werf converge --repo <DOCKER HUB USERNAME>/werf-guide-app
```

You should see the following output:
```shell

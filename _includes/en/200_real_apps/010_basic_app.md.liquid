## A new {{ page.framework_name }} application

In this chapter, we will use a new basic {{ page.framework_name }} application with the same feature set as the application from the previous section.

We got it like this - generated the directory structure for our {{ page.framework_name }} application by the command:

{% include 200_real_apps/010_basic_app/{{ page.framework_id }}/001_generate_app.md.liquid %}

> **Please Note!** The commands in the current section are for illustrative purposes only. They show how a basic application was generated. Only the commands in the "Deploying a new application" section are intended to be executed.

This application doesn't have any functionality that is not needed at this stage. The only thing left is the configuration for the production environment.

Then, a new `/ping` route has been added to the API:
{% include 200_real_apps/010_basic_app/{{ page.framework_id }}/005_add_ping.md.liquid %}

The `ping` method of the standard controller will handle this route (and return the `pong` string):
{% include 200_real_apps/010_basic_app/{{ page.framework_id }}/010_return_pong.md.liquid %}

As for the building and CI/CD, the most significant changes affected the image build process:
{% include 200_real_apps/010_basic_app/{{ page.framework_id }}/015_building_image.md.liquid %}

… while CI/CD changes were minimal. For example, here is the Deployment of the new application:
{% include 200_real_apps/010_basic_app/{{ page.framework_id }}/020_new_deployment.md.liquid %}

Our current application is stateless and does not need a database to run. We will show you how to turn it into a stateful application and deploy a dedicated database in the following chapters.

## Deploying a new application

Let's check if the new application is running fine by deploying it to the Kubernetes cluster:
```shell
werf converge --repo <DOCKER HUB USERNAME>/werf-guide-app
```

You should see the following output:
{% include 200_real_apps/010_basic_app/{{ page.framework_id }}/025_expected_result.md.liquid %}

Let's check whether our application works:
```shell
curl http://werf-guide-app/ping
```

You should see the following response:
```shell
pong
```

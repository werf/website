to enable Active Record and configure the application to work with MySQL (we will use the database to store the application state).

To get the Active Record and MySQL configuration, our skeleton Rails application was now generated using the following command (note that the `--database mysql` flag was added to the arguments while `--skip-active-record` was omitted):
```shell
rails new --database mysql \
  --skip-action-cable --skip-action-mailbox --skip-action-mailer --skip-action-text \
  --skip-active-job --skip-active-storage \
  --skip-javascript --skip-jbuilder --skip-turbolinks \
  --skip-keeps --skip-listen --skip-bootsnap --skip-spring --skip-sprockets \
  --skip-test --skip-system-test .
```

> **Please Note!** The commands in the current section are for illustrative purposes only. They show how a basic application was generated. Only the commands in the "Testing the application/database" section are intended to be executed.

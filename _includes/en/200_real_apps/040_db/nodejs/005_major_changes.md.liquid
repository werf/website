The following changes have been made to our application:

1. Installing dependencies for working with the MySQL database
1. Configuring access to the database
1. Adding a model and a migration for the database schema
1. Adding routes that use the new model

We used the following command to install the new dependencies:

```shell
npm i mysql2 sequelize sequelize-cli express-async-handler
```

- `mysql2` — MySQL driver
- `sequelize` — an ORM for the database
- `sequelize-cli` — a command-line tool for generating models and performing migrations
- `express-async-handler` — a wrapper over the query handlers to write async/await code

Also, a sequelize configuration file was created. It defines the structure of sequelize files and the database connection configuration.
All the DB-related directories are located in the `db` directory while the configuration is included in `config/database.json`:

{% include snippetcut_example path=".sequelizerc" syntax="javascript" examples=page.examples %}

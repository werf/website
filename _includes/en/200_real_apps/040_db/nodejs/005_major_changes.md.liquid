The following changes have been made to our application:

1. Dependencies for working with the MySQL database are installed.
1. Access to the database is configured.
1. Database model and schema migration are added.
1. Routes that use the new model are added.

We used the following command to install the new dependencies:

```shell
npm i mysql2 sequelize sequelize-cli express-async-handler
```

- `mysql2` — a MySQL driver;
- `sequelize` — an ORM for the database;
- `sequelize-cli` — a command-line tool for generating models and migrations;
- `express-async-handler` — a wrapper over the query handlers to write async/await code.

Also, a sequelize configuration file was created. It defines the structure of sequelize files and the database connection configuration.
All the DB-related directories are located in the `db` directory while the configuration is included in `config/database.json`:

{% include snippetcut_example path=".sequelizerc" syntax="javascript" examples=page.examples %}

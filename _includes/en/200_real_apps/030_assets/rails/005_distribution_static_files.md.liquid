By default, Rails does not even try to distribute static files in production environments. Instead, Rails developers suggest using a reverse proxy like NGINX for this task. This is because the reverse proxy distributes static files much more efficiently than Rails and Puma.

In practice, you can do without the reverse proxy running in front of an application only during development. In addition to efficiently serving static files, the reverse proxy nicely complements the application server (Puma) by providing many additional features not available at the application server itself. It also allows for fast and flexible request routing.

There are several ways to deploy the application server behind the reverse proxy in Kubernetes. We will use a popular and straightforward approach that nevertheless scales well. As part of it, the NGINX container is deployed into each Pod with the Rails/Puma container. This auxiliary container serves as a proxy for all Rails/Puma requests except for static file requests. These static files are served by the NGINX container.

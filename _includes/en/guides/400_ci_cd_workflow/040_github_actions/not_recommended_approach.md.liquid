We **do not recommend** using this approach in the case of GitHub since, at the moment, the system lacks the tooling for a hassle-free usage of Github Workflow. Handling specific commits and manual triggering partly boils down to using external events such as a [repository_dispatch](https://help.github.com/en/actions/reference/events-that-trigger-workflows#external-events-repository_dispatch) webhook. However, many cases still do not have a proper solution, which reduces the usefulness and maturity of this approach.

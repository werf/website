## Using the infrastructure

> In this chapter, we will learn some commands for interacting with the cluster, and in the [next](../100_basic/38_kubernetes_basics.html) chapter, we will look at them in more detail.

Let's make sure that the application is deployed (or let's deploy it if it's not yet deployed) by running the following command:
```shell
werf converge --repo <DOCKER HUB USERNAME>/werf-guide-app
```

The expected result:
```shell
...
Release "werf-guide-app" has been upgraded. Happy Helming!
NAME: werf-guide-app
LAST DEPLOYED: Thu Jul 22 15:32:10 2021
NAMESPACE: werf-guide-app
STATUS: deployed
REVISION: 6
TEST SUITE: None
Running time 30.27 seconds
```

### Viewing the status

There are several commands to view the status of a running application in Kubernetes.

Here is how you can get a list of running Deployments and Pods:
```shell
kubectl get deployment
```

{% offtopic title="View the output" %}
```shell
NAME             READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
werf-guide-app   1/1     1            1           5m41s
```
{% endofftopic %}

```shell
kubectl get pod
```

{% offtopic title="View the output" %}
```shell
NAME                              READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
werf-guide-app-57f854484f-8ktqp   1/1     Running   0          7m24s
```
{% endofftopic %}

Display the summary of the `werf-guide-app` Deployment:

Deployment runs the Pods, while logs are stored in the Pods. You can browse logs of one of the running Pods with the following command:
```shell
kubectl logs app-<podId>
```

{% offtopic title="View the output" %}
```shell

{% endofftopic %}

### Scaling

The web server is running as part of the `werf-guide-app` Deployment. Let's see how many replicas are running:

```shell
kubectl get pod
```

{% offtopic title="View the output" %}
```shell
NAME                              READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
werf-guide-app-57f854484f-8ktqp   1/1     Running   0          7m24s
```
{% endofftopic %}

Let's change it to 4 replicas:
```shell
kubectl edit deployment werf-guide-app
```

Text editor will be launched where you need to set `spec.replicas=4`; then close the editor.
Let's see how many replicas are running once again:
```shell
kubectl get pod
```

{% offtopic title="View the output" %}
```shell
NAME                              READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
werf-guide-app-57f854484f-2xbzl   1/1     Running   0          119m
werf-guide-app-57f854484f-8ktqp   1/1     Running   0          6h59m
werf-guide-app-57f854484f-kr9sl   1/1     Running   0          119m
werf-guide-app-57f854484f-r99j4   1/1     Running   0          118m
```
{% endofftopic %}

As you can see, we have scaled the cluster manually. Now, run `werf converge` once again:
```shell
werf converge --repo <DOCKER HUB USERNAME>/werf-guide-app
```

... and check the number of running replicas:
```shell
kubectl get pod
```

{% offtopic title="View the output" %}
```shell
NAME                              READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
werf-guide-app-57f854484f-2xbzl   1/1     Running   0          119m
```
{% endofftopic %}

The number of replicas corresponds to that specified in the Git repository. As you can see, werf brought the cluster state to the state described in the current Git commit. This principle is called [**giterminism**](https://en.werf.io/documentation/v1.2/advanced/giterminism.html).

So how do you comply with the principles of **giterminism** and do it all right? This time, let's set `spec.replicas=4` by describing the application state in Git:

{% include chapter_prepare_repo_commands.md.liquid examples_to=page.examples from_scratch=false %}

For this, we will use the `.helm/templates/deployment.yaml` file:

{% include snippetcut_example path=".helm/templates/deployment.yaml" syntax="yaml" examples=page.examples %}

Run the deployment process:
```shell
werf converge --repo <DOCKER HUB USERNAME>/werf-guide-app
```

And check how many replicas are running now:

```shell
kubectl get pod
```

{% offtopic title="View the output" %}
```shell
NAME                              READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
werf-guide-app-57f854484f-2xbzl   1/1     Running   0          119m
werf-guide-app-57f854484f-8ktqp   1/1     Running   0          6h59m
werf-guide-app-57f854484f-kr9sl   1/1     Running   0          119m
werf-guide-app-57f854484f-r99j4   1/1     Running   0          118m
```
{% endofftopic %}

Let's clean up the working directory so that it contains only one replica:

{% include chapter_prepare_repo_commands.md.liquid examples_to=page.examples_initial from_scratch=false %}

Check the contents of the `.helm/templates/deployment.yaml` file:

{% include snippetcut_example path=".helm/templates/deployment.yaml" syntax="yaml" examples=page.examples_initial %}

Run the deployment process:
```shell
werf converge --repo <DOCKER HUB USERNAME>/werf-guide-app
```

## Making changes to the application

Our application is a basic echo server. When requested using curl:
```shell
curl "http://werf-guide-app/ping"
```

… it responds with the `pong` word.

Let's make changes to the application code:

{% include chapter_prepare_repo_commands.md.liquid examples_to=page.examples_modify_app from_scratch=false %}

In the application code, the server response will change to `hello world`:

{% include snippetcut_example path="start.sh" syntax="bash" examples=page.examples_modify_app %}

Run the deployment process:
```shell
werf converge --repo <DOCKER HUB USERNAME>/werf-guide-app
```

Check the result:
```shell
curl "http://werf-guide-app/ping"
```

The server will respond with `hello world`.
Congratulations, we did it!

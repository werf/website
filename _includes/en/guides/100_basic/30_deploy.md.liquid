> **Please note! ** At this point, we have copied all the necessary files and committed the changes to the repository. The sections below are for information purposes only (up to the "Deploying in Kubernetes" section). You do not need to create or edit any files **!

## Deployment

The Deployment resource creates a set of resources for launching the application. Here is the example of the Deployment resource:

{% include snippetcut_example path=".helm/templates/deployment.yaml" syntax="yaml" examples=page.examples %}

Here, we insert the full name of the Docker image of our application using the template engine: {% raw %}`{{ .Values.werf.image.app }}`{% endraw %}. Note that you must use the component name specified in `werf.yaml` (`app` in our case) to access this value.

werf automatically adds full names of the images to build as well as other [service data]({{ site.url }}/documentation/v2/advanced/helm/configuration/values.html#service-values) to values of the Helm Chart (`.Values`). You can access them using the `werf` key.

werf only rebuilds images when the added files are changed (those used in the Dockerfile `COPY/ADD` instructions) or if `werf.yaml` itself is changed. The image tag will also change during a rebuild resulting in the Deployment update. If no changes were made to the files mentioned above, the werf would not rebuild the image. The Deployment and the resources it creates will not be redeployed because the latest version of the application is already running in the cluster.

## Service

The Service resource allows other applications in the cluster to connect to your application:

{% include snippetcut_example path=".helm/templates/service.yaml" syntax="yaml" examples=page.examples %}

## Ingress

The Ingress resource manages *external* access to the cluster (unlike a Service in Kubernetes that defines a policy for accessing applications *inside* the cluster). The Ingress configuration defines what Service to use for external traffic sent to the `werf-guide-app.test` domain.

{% include snippetcut_example path=".helm/templates/ingress.yaml" syntax="yaml" examples=page.examples %}

## Deploying to Kubernetes

> Note that you need to go back to the previous chapter and recreate the registry secret if you deleted the application namespace.

The [werf converge]({{ site.url }}/documentation/v2/reference/cli/werf_converge.html) command builds the application and deploys it to Kubernetes:
```shell
werf converge --repo <DOCKER HUB USERNAME>/werf-guide-app
```

The following output indicates that the process has been completed successfully:
```shell

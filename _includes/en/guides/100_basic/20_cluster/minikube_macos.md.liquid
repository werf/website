### Installing and running minikube

Install/update minikube [using this guide](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/). Make sure that you have the latest version installed.

Create a new Kubernetes cluster using minikube:
```shell
# delete the existing minikube cluster (if exists)
minikube delete
# start a new minikube cluster
minikube start --driver=docker
```

Set the default Namespace so that you don't have to specify it every time you invoke `kubectl`:
```shell
kubectl config set-context minikube --namespace=werf-guide-app
```

You will see the following output:
```shell
Context "minikube" modified.
```

If you do not have the kubectl utility installed, then install it [using this guide](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl-macos/).

Now let's check if the new Kubernetes cluster is working by displaying the list of Pods running in it:
```shell
kubectl get --all-namespaces pod
```

You will see something like this:
```shell
NAMESPACE     NAME                               READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
kube-system   coredns-558bd4d5db-8jfng           1/1     Running   0          48s
kube-system   etcd-minikube                      1/1     Running   0          61s
kube-system   kube-apiserver-minikube            1/1     Running   0          54s
kube-system   kube-controller-manager-minikube   1/1     Running   0          54s
kube-system   kube-proxy-b87f2                   1/1     Running   0          48s
kube-system   kube-scheduler-minikube            1/1     Running   0          65s
kube-system   storage-provisioner                1/1     Running   0          56s
```

Your Kubernetes cluster is up and running if both statements are true:
* in the 4th column, all the Pods from the list are `Running` or `Completed`;
* in the 3rd column, for all `Running` Pods, the left (`X`) and right (`Y`) numbers are equal in the `X/Y` statement (i.e., Pod containers have started successfully).

Please wait a while and run the command above again to get the status of Pods, if not all of them have started successfully.

### Installing NGINX Ingress Controller

Install the NGINX Ingress Controller:
```shell
minikube addons enable ingress
```

You will see the following output:
```shell
...
ðŸ”Ž  Verifying ingress addon...
ðŸŒŸ  The 'ingress' addon is enabled
```

Give it a few minutes and check if the Ingress Controller has started successfully:
```shell
kubectl -n ingress-nginx get pod
```

You will see something like this:
```shell
NAME                                        READY   STATUS      RESTARTS   AGE
ingress-nginx-admission-create-qrcdg        0/1     Completed   0          8m12s
ingress-nginx-admission-patch-8pw4d         0/1     Completed   0          8m12s
ingress-nginx-controller-59b45fb494-fscgf   1/1     Running     0          8m12s
```

### Updating the hosts file

We will use the `werf-guide-app.test` domain for accessing the application. Let's append the IP address/hostname to the hosts file:
```shell
echo "$(minikube ip) werf-guide-app.test" | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts
```

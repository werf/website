If nothing worked, repeat all the steps described in the ["Preparing the environment"](/guides/{{ page.framework_id | append: "/100_basic/20_cluster.html" | relative_url }}) chapter and create a new environment from scratch. If creating an environment from scratch did not help either, please, tell us about your problem in our [Telegram chat]({{ site.data.guides.links.werf_telegram }}) or create an issue on [GitHub]({{ site.data.guides.links.werf_guides_github }}). We will be happy to help you!

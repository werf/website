## Preliminary steps

Let's add the following libraries:

```shell
npm i @aws-sdk/client-s3 express-fileupload readable-web-to-node-stream
```

- `@aws-sdk/client-s3` — for working with an AWS S3-compatible storage;
- `express-fileupload` — for getting a file in the express request;
- `readable-web-to-node-stream` — for converting *web stream* to *node stream* (this one comes in handy for sending files to the client).

We will use the `@aws-sdk/client-s3` since the MinIO interface is compatible with AWS S3. In addition, it makes it easier to migrate to AWS S3 if necessary.

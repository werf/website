To do this, you will need a logger that supports JSON output. In our example, we will use `pino` (don't forget to uninstall the default logger):

```shell
$ npm uninstall morgan
$ npm install pino pino-http
```

Connect the logger to the server:

{% include snippetcut_example path="app.js" syntax="javascript" snippet="logger-import,logger-usage" examples=page.examples %}

Thanks to the `pino-http` library, you can now access the `pino` logger via the `res.log` response object.
This way, you only need to initialize the logger once, and then you can use it as a dependency in the code:

{% include snippetcut_example path="routes/ping.js" syntax="javascript" snippet="logger-usage" examples=page.examples %}

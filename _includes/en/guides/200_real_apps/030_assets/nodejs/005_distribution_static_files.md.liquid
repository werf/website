A Node.js application can serve static files, e.g., in the express framework, you can make a controller using `express.static`. However, the authors of express recommend using a server like NGINX to serve static files. This is because the reverse proxy distributes static files much more efficiently than Node.js.

In practice, you can do without the reverse proxy running in front of an application only during development. In addition to efficiently serving static files, the reverse proxy nicely complements the application server by providing many additional features non-implemented at the application server level as well as fast and flexible request routing.

There are several ways to deploy the application server behind the reverse proxy in Kubernetes. We will use a popular and straightforward method that also scales well. As part of it, the NGINX container is deployed to each Pod with the Node.js container. This auxiliary container serves as a proxy for all requests except for static file requests. The NGINX container is responsible for the distribution of static files.

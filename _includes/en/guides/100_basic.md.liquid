In this chapter, we will build an image and deploy our application to Kubernetes.

We will use a tiny shell-script as an example application. This script returns `pong` in response to a request to the `/ping` endpoint. We will set up the environment to use werf, deploy the application to a local Minikube cluster, make changes to the application and modify its configuration, and review some useful theoretical information about working with werf and Kubernetes.

In the next chapter, this shell-script will be replaced with a {{ page.framework_name }} application. We will gradually add new functionality to it with each new chapter, eventually ending up with an app that resembles the real-life one.

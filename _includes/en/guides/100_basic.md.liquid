In this chapter, we will build an image and deploy our application to Kubernetes.

We will use a **tiny shell-script** as an example application. This script returns `pong` in response to a request to the `/ping` endpoint. We will set up the environment to use werf, deploy the application to a local Minikube cluster, make changes to the application and modify its configuration, and review some useful theoretical information about working with werf and Kubernetes.

After you gain this basic knowledge, in the next chapter ("Real-world apps"), our shell-script will be replaced with a **{{ page.framework_name }} application**. We will gradually add new functionality to it with each new chapter, eventually ending up with an app that resembles the real-life one.

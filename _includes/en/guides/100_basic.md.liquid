This guide will show you how to build an image using werf and deploy it to Kubernetes.

## The application

We will use a tiny shell-script as an example application. This script returns `pong` in response to a request to the `/ping` endpoint. In the next chapter, this shell-script will be replaced with a {{ page.framework_name }} application. We will gradually add new functionality to it with each new chapter, eventually ending up with an app that resembles the real-life one.

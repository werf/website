## Working with source code and giterminism

Generally, some of the settings that affect the configuration of the deployed application are based on external data, such as parameters of the environment used for building and deploying an application, pre-defined environment variables, generated files, external resources involved in the process, etc. This directly leads to the inability to guarantee the reproducibility of the application state.

{% offtopic title="Why do we need reproducibility?" %}
The ability to reproduce a specific application state at any moment makes the debugging process easier, allowing us to deploy the copy of the project for development or testing purposes. Plus, it makes the results of testing more credible and dependable thanks to a lower number of hidden parameters affecting the application state.

The reproducibility is essential for implementing the [Infrastructure as Code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure_as_code) approach and immutable infrastructure.

## The standard mode

werf follows the  **giterminism** principle to ensure reproducibility. That is, the current Git state (HEAD commit) _determines_ the state of the application. By default, werf does not allow uncommitted and untracked files in the build context/configuration of the images being built. It also excludes functionality that potentially has external dependencies.

We strongly recommend following this approach. However, if necessary, you can loosen giterminism restrictions explicitly and enable the features that require careful use. You can do this using the [werf-giterminism.yaml]({{ site.url }}/documentation/reference/werf_giterminism_yaml.html) file.

During development or debugging, editing the project files might be annoying due to the need to create intermediate commits. We recommend using the [developer mode](#the-dev-mode).

_The detailed documentation on determinism is available [here]({{ site.url }}/documentation/advanced/giterminism.html)._

### The dev mode

With the dev mode, you can loosen giterminism restrictions and work with non-committed changes. The mode is enabled by the `--dev` option or `WERF_DEV` environment variable. 

In the developer mode, werf uses all tracked and untracked changes while taking into account the `.gitignore` rules as well as user-defined exceptions set by the `--dev-ignore=<glob>` option or the `WERF_DEV_IGNORE_<ANY>` environment variable.

### The follow mode

In the follow mode, werf automatically re-runs the command in response to the Git state changes:

- the command is restarted when a new commit is created;
- together with the [dev mode](#the-dev-mode) (`--dev`) in response to any changes.

You can enable it via the `--follow` parameter or `WERF_FOLLOW` environment variable.

### Choosing the mode for local development

Summary table of werf operating modes:

| Mode                                               | no flags   | \-\-dev   | \-\-follow | \-\-dev \-\-follow |
| -------------------------------------------------- | ------------ | --------- | ---------- | ------------------ |
| working with committed files only                  | +            | -         | +          | -                  |
| working with non-committed changes                 | -            | +         | -          | +                  |
| restarting the deploy process automatically        | -            | -         | +          | +                  |

## Building and tagging images

### Building

The classic approach to building images using native Docker tools involves `docker build` and `docker tag` commands. After the build is complete, you have to push the newly created image to the registry (using the `docker push` command).

In werf, the entire process can be carried out with just one command — `werf build`. Read [this article](https://blog.flant.com/werf-vs-docker-comparison/) to learn more about the differences between werf and Docker.

In addition, werf supports the following features out of the box (they are enabled by default):

* [**parallel builds**]({{ site.url }}/documentation/v1.2/internals/build_process.html#parallel-build), when multiple independent images get assembled simultaneously;
* **distributed builds**. In this mode, werf builds each layer using different builders. The synchronization and locking mechanisms enable the reuse of common layers and preserve the reproducibility of all builds.

### Tagging images

In the manual deployment process (i.e., without werf), you have to define strict rules for tagging images and follow them (TBH, that's no [easy task](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oh4N2wBJCc8)). On the other hand, werf uses the following construct in [charts](#releases-and-helm): {% raw %}`image: {{ .Values.werf.image.app }}`{% endraw %}:

{% raw %}
```yaml
      - name: app
        image: {{ .Values.werf.image.app }}
        command: ["/app/start.sh"]
```
{% endraw %}

Thus, werf **frees you of worries about tagging rules**: if there are changes in the code, it will rebuild the appropriate image, add service tags to it, push it to the registry, and insert the applicable image name into the templates. For this, werf stores metadata in the registry and tracks the file contents in the Git repository. 

{% offtopic title="How does it work?" %}
werf implements the so-called [content-based tagging](https://blog.flant.com/content-based-tagging-in-the-werf-builder/) (in other words, tags depend on the content): it automatically builds and deploys images in response to changes in Git contents. What matters is images do not change with every commit (there are no unnecessary re-deployments) if the content in Git has not changed.

Usually, you have to define the principles for naming images in the registry. In our case, you do not have to worry about that: werf can automatically tag images for you.

In short, werf calculates the checksum of files added to images and generates tags for the image based on it. It uses an [MVCC-based](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MVCC) approach and [optimistic locking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimistic_concurrency_control) to make sure that there are no conflicts between various builds running simultaneously (including running on different servers).

For more information about how data is stored in the registry, refer to the [werf documentation]({{ site.url }}/documentation/internals/stages_and_storage.html). It thoroughly describes the build process, how werf manages build stage dependencies, and how the naming is performed.

## Releases and Helm

werf uses Helm to deploy the application. [Helm chart](https://helm.sh/docs/topics/charts/) is a set of files that describes a related set of Kubernetes objects. A _release_ is created when the chart is rolled out to a particular environment in a cluster.

{% offtopic title="Learn more" %}
The [werf documentation]({{ site.url }}/documentation/v1.2/advanced/helm/releases/release.html) provides a detailed description of working with releases, storing and naming them.
{% endofftopic %}

When working with releases, werf follows giterminism principles. For Helm releases, it uses the [3-way merge](https://helm.sh/docs/faq/#improved-upgrade-strategy-3-way-strategic-merge-patches) approach: manual changes to the cluster that conflict with the state described in Git are corrected to conform to the latter. Note that manual changes that do _not_ conflict with the state defined in Git remain outside the control of Helm and werf.

werf manages releases on its own, but if you want to do it the hard way, you can use the `werf helm <...>` commands.

You can read more about werf and Helm in [this article](https://blog.flant.com/werf-vs-helm-comparison/).

### How do I list the installed components?

A specific state of the deployed application is called a release. Releases provide information about components installed in the cluster (using werf and Helm), their state, and the environment they are running in.

To browse the list of releases or find out the name of the release you need, use the [`werf helm list -A`]({{ site.url }}/documentation/reference/cli/werf_helm_list.html) command.

### How do I delete the unneeded component?

Use [`werf dismiss`]({{ site.url }}/documentation/reference/cli/werf_dismiss.html) to uninstall a specific release of an application.

### Debugging the installation process

Debugging allows you to see what went wrong while werf was running. Frequently, mistakes made in chart configurations lead to problems when rolling out a release. The [`werf render`]({{ site.url }}/documentation/reference/cli/werf_render.html) command can help you in debugging such problems.

werf render performs all the tasks related to the building and generating charts, showing you the resulting charts instead of deploying the release to Kubernetes. It is a compute-intensive task that shows you the final result with all the required values filled in.

_Note that `werf render` only works with files committed to Git (like all other werf commands); however, it supports the `--dev` mode._

## Cleaning up

Over time, a lot of data can accumulate in the storage (either local or in the registry). werf has two types of cleaning commands with different purposes: `werf cleanup` и `werf purge` (refer to the [documentation]({{ site.url }}/documentation/advanced/cleanup.html) to learn more). The first one cleans up data in the container registry only, while the second one can clean up all werf-related data.

### werf cleanup

The [`werf cleanup`]({{ site.url }}/documentation/reference/cli/werf_cleanup.html) command cleans up outdated data in the registry. It safely deletes images that are no longer required using an advanced algorithm that takes into account the Git history, the contents of the registry, and the state of the cluster. If the `--repo <reponame>` key is provided, the command will clean a specific repository.

The [`werf host cleanup`]({{ site.url }}/documentation/v1.2/advanced/cleanup.html#cleaning-up-outdated-data) command is used to clean up the outdated data on the host.

### werf purge

The [`werf host purge`]({{ site.url }}/documentation/reference/cli/werf_host_purge.html) command allows you to free up disk space by deleting all images and other data.

The [`werf purge`]({{ site.url }}/documentation/reference/cli/werf_purge.html) command purges all werf-related data on a host. Caution! werf purge (NOT SAFE) deletes all images, including those linked to applications running in the cluster!
